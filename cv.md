## __ABOUT ME__

Hi!My name is Kirill. I am a beginner web developer.
My purpose is to learn **JS(React, Angular) + C#** languages for having a new interesting(maybe not :D) job.
I learn something new about C# and JS every day and I like to do it!
I have been working as a production engineer in a big company about five years. We design cars.
When I was at university I realy liked programming, but i didn't understand how important it was.
But this year I said to myself: It's time for a change!
