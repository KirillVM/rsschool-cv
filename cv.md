## __ABOUT ME__

Hi!My name is Kirill. I am a beginner web developer.
My purpose is to learn JS(React, Angular) + C# languages for having a new interesting(maybe not :D) job.
I learn something new about C# and JS every day and I like it!
I have worked as a production engineer in a big company over five years. We made cars.
When I was at university I realy liked programming, but i didn't understand how important it was.
But this year I said to myself: It's time to change!
